Large family?  Sick of whiteboards on the fridge that just get smudgy?  Hate it when some responsibilities end up not completed when someone assumes someone else already did it? Or worse, did you just clean that already clean bathroom sink?  Well, those days are gone now that ListMonkey is in the house!  Can't remember which kid you asked to scrub the toilet?  Forget just exactly who's week it is to take out the trash?  Don't have a Roomba and fighting with your significant other over who vaccuums on Monday?  If so, then let Choremonkey take care of the planning.  We promise, once you incorporate Choremonkey into your busy family and its busy life, you won't go bananas over a messy living room or unmopped kitchen floor ever again!

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:
React.js with Firebase


Why did you choose this framework?

- React is just incredible at what it does, and that is rendering UI.
- React has a huge community and ecosystem of available submodules.
- Because of the constant change of data, React was an ideal choice for the type of data our application is rendering.
- It was the most well known among the team, and although we've dabbled in Vue, and one of us tried Angular once on a weekend, we felt that devouting another weekend to Angular or learning more about Vue would be best suited for a time after we completed labs.

Dependencies:
- React Router
- UUID
- Firebase
- Firebase Tools
- Firebase Auth
- Firebase Firestore

#### Front end deployed to Firebase Hosting
